# Getting Started with Notetastic App

This project was bootstrapped with React JS and Material UI.\
This is a note maintaining app made to help you in safekeeping your notes and task list.\
I had used latest Javascript ES6 functions like map(), filter(), Arrow function and Spread Operator in development of this app.\
Also using React Hooks and React Props I had implimented some very usefull functionalities like adding notes and their deletion.\
This app uses the local storage of your browser to maintain your notes data even after the relod.\
